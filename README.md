## Codemaster

Built with Next.js

I have been teaching to code for a while now, and I've seen that most of that people 
who want to learn how to code can easily do it, but they don't know where to start. There are so many resources out there, and it's hard to know which ones are actually good.

So I decided to create this website, where I will be selling courses that focus on teaching you how to code without holding your hand. The courses will also include
 projects that you will be able to do on your own, and resources to help you if you get stuck.

#### Planned courses

- Building a complete frontend website with React
- Creating an Android app with Kotlin and Android Studio
- Object-Oriented Programming with C#
